I am a highly motivated fifth-year computer science undergraduate at Sharif
University of Technology, Iran with a strong passion for learning and research.

My primary research interests lie in computer systems, verification, and programming languages. I am currently looking for PhD positions for Fall 2025.

During my university years, I attended a software engineering bootcamp, which sparked my fascination with programming languages. As I gained more experience, I delved into computer systems and verification, finding these areas particularly interesting due to their critical role in the foundations of many real-world, mission-critical software projects.
