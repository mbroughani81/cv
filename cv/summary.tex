I am a highly motivated fifth-year computer science undergraduate student at Sharif University of Technology (Iran) with a strong passion for learning and research. My journey in the field of computer science began during my high school years when I discovered programming and algorithms, which sparked my curiosity and love for the field.

During my university years, I attended a software engineering bootcamp, which sparked my fascination with programming languages. As I gained more experience, I delved into computer systems and verification, finding these areas particularly interesting due to their critical role in the foundations of many real-world, mission-critical software projects.
