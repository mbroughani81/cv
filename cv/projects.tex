    \item {As a suggestion from a graduate student about his field - programming languages - I started to read the \href{https://craftinginterpreters.com/}{\textit{Crafting Interpreters}} book. Following along the book, I got better a better insight into the way that languages are implemented and the design decisions that are made in the meanwhile.}
    \item {\textbf{Technical Skills:} Parsing - Context Free Grammars - Interpreters design - Programming language design}

        \begin{itemize}
        \item  Formal Verification: \newline
          Attended recorded \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwabKnOFhE38C0o6z_bhlF_uOUlblDTjh}{\textit{"Model Checking"}} course by Prof. Katoen. In this course I learned how we can use Model Checking methods to verify some behavior in complex software systems.
          \newline
          I also read about the basics of LEAN proof assistant and how to formalizing program semantics from The \href{https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2023}{\textit{Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Logical Verification}} book.
        \item  Concurrency: \newline
          Reading \href{https://pragprog.com/titles/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks/}{\textit{Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks}} helped me to learn about different ways we can use concurrency in software engineering.
        \item Computer Architecture:
          \newline
          After reading
          \href{http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/samples.html}{\textit{
              Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective}} I learned a lot about important aspects of hardware design and how they can be used to achieve high performance in software.
        \item Programming Languages:
          \newline
          Interesting books like \textit{SICP} and \textit{Crafting Interpreters} helped me to get deep knowledge in programming languages theory.

%      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of project
%       \item {After encountering the software architecture challenges and working with different programming paradigms in the Rahnema College bootcamp, I decided to study more about programming language theory and the solutions they provide for software development. As a suggestion from bootcamp teachers, I read the book \href{https://leanpub.com/fp-made-easier}{\textit{Functional Programming Made Easier}} and got many useful and practical ideas about software development. Recently I got interested in learning about concurrency and the pros and cons of the way that different programming languages support this facility. An interesting book that I read while doing this study is \href{https://pragprog.com/titles/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks/}{\textit{Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks}}. After reading this book, I got a grasp of solutions for developing concurrent programs and their use cases.}
